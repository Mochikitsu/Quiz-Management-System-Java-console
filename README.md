# Quiz-Management-System-Java-console
The Java-based Quiz Management System developed by the team serves as a console application designed to modernize academic assessments. This system provides instructors with tools to create timed quizzes containing up to 50 multiple-choice questions, each featuring exactly four options (A-D). Educators can configure test durations between 1-180 minutes while automatically receiving performance analytics including student scores, completion times, and submission records. 

For examinees, the platform offers a streamlined testing environment with real-time feedback. Upon completing quizzes, participants immediately access their results with detailed answer comparisons. The development team implemented strict input validation protocols to prevent empty submissions and restrict responses to valid A-D choices. Java's built-in time API ensures precise duration tracking throughout examination sessions.

Several intentional design constraints govern the system's functionality. The application maintains a text-only interface without graphical elements, stores all data temporarily in runtime memory, and supports only one active quiz at any time. These limitations reflect the project's scope as a focused solution for basic assessment needs. When executed, the program generates clear outputs: instructors view formatted student performance reports, while test-takers receive personalized score breakdowns showing correct and incorrect responses.
